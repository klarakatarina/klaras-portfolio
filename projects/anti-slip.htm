          Bachelor’s degree project creating an anti-slip protection for a
          walker. Several qualitative interviews were conducted with users of
          walkers. From them, problematic areas in walking on snowy and icy
          paths, was discovered. Many different concepts turned to two
          functional prototypes. They were tested by a control group on a
          make-shift ice rink, and evaluated against requirements created from
          the interviews and research on the target user group.
